# Reservoir Raid

## REGISTRATION:
This event is held every two weeks and during the preparation stage R4 or R5 can register Alliance to participate in the Event Center. 
All alliance members can vote on preferred timeslot for the event to take place. 
Once time slot has been confirmed members must register to participate. 
Only 30 members can participate, with a further 15 member as reservists. 

## Opponent
From the alliances that participate, your alliance will be matched up with one alliance from another state with similar in battle power.

## Basics
This event takes place on a special map. 
Both of the competing alliances start at opposite corners of the map. 
The map contains about 10 buildings that you should try to occupy to earn points, which will be explained below.

The objective of the event is for the alliance to get the most points (purified water).
By occupying buildings and gathering the resource you also get personal points. 
You can also get personal points by wounding enemy troops. 

At the end of the event you also get rewards based on your individual point rank.

During the event you get a free advanced relocator every 5min, healing speedups, and march speed ups. The free items can only be used during the event. You may also use the items stored in your backpack.

*Important note:* 
Advance relocators used from backpack increase exponentially. First time used from backpack consumes 1, second time consumes 2, third time consumes 4

The troops you use can not be killed in the event, only wounded. They will be sent to a hospital, which you should keep an eye and heal for 1 hour intervals (using speed ups). After the event any wounded troops will automatically be healed 

Be mindful when attacking players or buildings that if they are strong then it is best to set rallies and notify the chat that you are setting a rally.

## Game chats:
There are two game chats for this event, you will have an event chat which the whole team in the event can read and speak, and there is also a strike team chat for your individual teams to co-ordinate.

## OUR STRATEGY:
On the last day of registration reset your talents. Do not allocate talent points until after registration is complete. This will lower our overall strength which could match us with a weaker opponent.

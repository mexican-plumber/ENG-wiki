# Influencer Trap

## EVENT OVERVIEW: 
The Influencer Trap is an Alliance event during which Alliance members can send their armies to battle Infected Influencers using rallies, and gain rewards according to their rank.

To open the Trap, Alliance members need to donate Energy cells to trap. Which also provide attack buff during the event. 

When the required amount of Energy Cells has been donated, an R5 or R4 can activate an influencer trap. We will then have 30 minutes to defeat the infected influencer.

## OUR STRATEGY:
All members must start a rally against the Infected Influencer with their strongest Heros. 
Then join the next available Rally against the Infected with all their remaining matches. 
Once your rally hits and troops return immediately send out your rally again and join other rallies with remaining marches. 

This cycle will continue until the 30min has passed whether you have killed the Infected or not.

4. Pay attention and listen to R4/R5 messages. If asked to do something, please do it in a reasonable time frame.

5. Keep up to date with State Rules.
    - It is your responsibility to ensure you are not contravening any of the rules. Should you be found to be in contravention of state rules, punishment will be issued against you. This may be anything from verbal warning to being kicked from the alliance.

    - Do not engage in mud slinging or bad mouthing on State Chat.

# Alliance Showdown

## ABOUT THE EVENT: 
This event works through passive participation.  Once you have registered it the event does not affect your settlement, troops or gameplay at all.

During the event the alliance faces you off against 5 other alliances from other states in the same rank as you in the event. i.e Gold, 5 Stars

There are three Lanes available in which we can register: Left, Centre and Right Lane. 
During the event there are 5 Rounds, in order to win the battle you need to win 2 out of 3 Lanes.

## EVENT REGISTRATION:
Your Battle Power is determined by a few things that we will discuss below:

## Hero: 
Your Heros all have different benefits when they are selected. Please familiarize yourself with your Hero benefits.

## Troop Strength: 
Troops refer to Infantry (Barracks), Riders (Garage) and Hunters (Range).  The Troop strength is determined by your Troop level (T1 to T10), Battle research (Defense, Attack, Health and Lethality) and your Chief Talents (WAR: Defense, Attack, Health and Lethality) and any temporary Buffs applied.

## March Capacity: 
Your march capacity is the number of troops that you can send on any single march.  Your march capacity is determined by your HQ level, Battle research (March Capacity) in your Research Lab and your Chief Talents (WAR - March Capacity) and any temporary Buffs applied.

When registering for the event it is important to always maximize Battle Power by selecting your strongest Heros and selecting your strongest Troops and have the highest possible March Capacity. 
We also suggest a troop formation of 60% Infantry, 20% Ryders and 20% Hunters 

Make sure your Chief Talents are allocated to WAR, this will ensure that your troop strength and march capacity is increased. There is also a special talent called Massive March that when activated increased your march by 10% for 30min.  You can also activate other temporary buffs located under your HQ to increase your march capacity. These buffs will cost BioCaps to activate. Use at your own discretion.
The event will use all the Hero, Troops, March and Buffs active while you register or update your troops. The event and will not change your Battle Power once you have finalized your registration or updated your troops. 
Moving between lanes once registered will not affect your Battle Power.

## OUR ALLIANCE STRATEGY:
Because  you  only need to win two of the three lanes we want to have our strongest players concentrated in two lanes. This will give us a higher statistical chance of winning the battle. 

We have chosen the Centre and Right lane as our two focused lanes. 
During registration you might be contacted to switch lanes, please do this as soon as possible as you cannot move lanes once the tournament starts. 

Once you become a reservist in any of the lanes please amend your troops to 1 Unit with no Hero’s in your March. 

The alliance leadership team will make adjustments to the position of the registered lanes during the event to find the best possible chance to win the upcoming battle. 

Any questions or suggestions please  feel free  to  contact  any  of  the  Leadership  Team.

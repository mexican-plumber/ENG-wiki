# State 192 Rules

1. No zeroing [destroying all enemy troops] unless you formally declare war - 3 hit maximum per alliance on a single player every 24 hours is allowed.

2. Tile hitting [gathering tiles - farms, wood, metal, gas] is only allowed if a player from another alliance is farming on tiles in your territory. (KE excluded to this)

3. Do not hit settlements or farms during events like FORTRESS FIGHT, RESERVOIR RAID, INFLUENCER TRAP, HORDE EVENT. ( RECONNING IS NOT ALLOWED DURING THE SAID EVENTS )

4. The CC area [the grey box around capital] is a death zone - players in the box may be attacked.
   - ONE HOUR before CC begins, the CC box becomes sanctuary. ANY attack within the 1 hour window will feel the states wrath after.

5. During the kill event, all state rules are void except :
   - tiles may be hit. (DO NOT FARM DURING KE or FARM AT YOUR OWN RISK)
   - 3 attacks maximum per alliance on a single player (see state rule #1)
   - DO NOT hit settlements during fortress/capital fights that coincide.

6. Once KE ends, state NAP goes into effect for 24 hours and all state rules reapply. [tile hits in your territory allowed]

7. After CC ended, the 24 hour STATEWIDE NAP will be in effect at server reset. This is to clear confusion as most of the time there is still an ongoing KILL EVENT after CC. Bubble if you dont want to get hit. 

8. There will be punishment for any party that does not abide by the rules, as the Top teams will deal with it if a quick solution between the two conflicting parties is not completed within 48 hours.

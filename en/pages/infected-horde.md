# Infected Horde

## EVENT OVERVIEW:
Only the Alliance Leader or any R4 can start event. 
There will be 20 waves of Infected Hordes sent out from the Dev Camps towards your Alliance. The Horde will attack all Alliance member Settlements. 
The more waves you defend against successfully, the better rewards you will receive.

Before the start
Switch your Chief talents over to the WAR tree;
A Peace Flare does not affect the Infected Horde attack. 
Make sure you recall all your troops (farming/rallying) in advance;
Some of your troops will get wounded – check hospital capacity before and during the event;
Event might take up to 2 hours to complete –
Event rewards are sent in 24 hours after the end of the event. Be patient :slight_smile:

## INFECTED WAVES:
There are 3 types of waves:

### Normal Wave:
Attacks all HQs of your alliance. It will be counted as a successful defence if more than 50% of one wave is killed by each participant.
If you don’t kill 50%, your settlement will start burning and you have one more chance to defend against next wave.
If you fail a second time, you’re not attacked anymore and it is advised to reinforce those who survived.

Participants won’t lose resources if they are defeated.

### Selective Wave:
Waves #7, #14 and #17 will attack only 15 random Settlements. Make sure you reinforce all of them to earn more points.

### Alliance HQ Wave:
Waves #10 and #20 will attack only Alliance HQ building. Wave #10 can be reinforced by everyone, it’s quite easy. As for wave #20, you will have to reinforce that building with your best troops and highest rally capacity player should occupy building first (for applying his rally capacity to the building).

Your alliance will earn more points killing all the attacking horde by successfully defending Settlements under attack. 
Points are awarded proportionally to the number of Infected killed during each wave. The event will end either when all allies have failed twice or after the 20th wave has hit the Alliance HQ.
